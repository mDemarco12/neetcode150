# neetcode150
This repo contains neetcode's top 150 leetcode questions to build your data structure knowledge. 
This repo will be organized in the following order: the main branch will contain this README and folders related to each section in Neetcode's 150. 

The folders will contain a Python file for each question and solution(s) method(s) if there are multiple ways to solve the answer. If you have trouble, I have included an explanation of the question and solution (I will leave it out so you can read the code to interpret the solution.)
I will revisit these 150 questions and keep the repo updated, please feel free to revise when possible! 

Above all, this repo will help me code in Python/Java, leverage data structures, and serve as a test environment to improve. I once thought "If I liked coding I would be a software engineer" because I hated coding and I sucked at it. But I continue to improve and one day I will do great things with the knowledge gained from this exercise in self-discipline. 

Thanks for stopping by, please leave a star or provide feedback if you found this repo useful!
