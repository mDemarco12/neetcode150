# neetcode150
This repo contains neetcode's top 150 leetcode questions to build your data structure knowledge. 
This repo will be organized in the following order: the main branch will contain this README and folders related to each section in Neetcode's 150. 

The folders will contain individual Python files. Each file contains the solution(s) if multiple ways exist to solve the answer. I will revisit these 150 questions as necessary; please feel free to revise when possible! 

Above all, this repo will help me code in Python, leverage data structures, and serve as a test environment to improve. I once thought "If I liked coding I would be a software engineer" because I hated coding and I sucked at it. But I continue to dedicate myself to this exercise, to improve one day at a time. 

Thanks for stopping by, please leave a star or provide feedback if you found this repo useful!
