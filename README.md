# neetcode150
This repo contains neetcode's top 150 leetcode questions to build your data structure knowledge. 
This repo will be organized in the following order: the main branch will contain this README and folders related to each section in Neetcode's 150. 
The folders will contain an individual Python file for each question. Inside the file will be the prompt, a section to answer, and the solution(s) is there are multiple ways to solve the answer. If you have trouble, an explanation of the question and solution will also be included.
I will revisit these 150 questions and keep the repo updated, please feel free to revise when possible!
