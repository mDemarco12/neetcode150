What is Polish Notation (PN)? Well it is a arithmetic approach invented by... you guessed it... a polish guy (Jan ≈Åukasiewicz)
Jokes asides, polish notation is math optimized for computer operations using a set of instructions and operators.
There are different approaches to PN, but we will focus on reverse PN. 
Numbers are declared and operations are assigned . (123*+) is (1*2+3). Dividing will reverse the assignment of operators

Treat operators + and - as default assignment (A + B), while operators * and / will be reversed ( B / A)
Use a stack to track most recent numeral and pop numeral/operator when encountered. 
Use if else statements to append and pop from the stacks. 
After all operations are complete, the solution is in index[0] of the stack.
